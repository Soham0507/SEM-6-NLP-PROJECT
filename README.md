Project Title:
Classifying patient-reported symptoms into possible diseases or conditions using Natural Language Processing
Project Abstract:
In contemporary healthcare, precise and timely diagnosis is essential for successful treatment and patient care. This project aims to create a system consisting of a Machine Learning Model, Deep Learning Model, and Language Model that categorizes patient-reported symptoms into potential diseases or medical conditions. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, the system reads and processes descriptions of symptoms to improve diagnostic precision.
The data set employed in the present research contains 30 individual diseases, with forty individual symptom descriptions each, thus providing a representative and diverse input for model training. Numerous text preprocessing methods, such as converting to lowercase, tokenization, stemming, removal of stopwords, removal of punctuations, and removal of extra white space, are utilized to preprocess the symptom data prior to its provision to the classification model. 
The findings show that the system accurately identifies the possible diagnoses, minimizing the chances of misdiagnosis and maximizing general patient care. By automating the preliminary symptom analysis, the model helps healthcare professionals optimize the prioritization of difficult cases, resource allocation, and clinical decision-making. The strategy has the potential to facilitate diagnostic workflows, ultimately leading to a more efficient and accurate healthcare system.
